Description: An application to calculate a patient's pretest
    probability (PTP) for obstructive Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) from 
    a collection of guidelines or studies. Guidelines usually comes from the 
    American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC) or 
    European Society of Cardiology (ESC). Examples of PTP scores that comes from studies are the 
    2020 Winther et al. basic, Risk Factor-weighted Clinical Likelihood (RF-CL) and 
    Coronary Artery Calcium Score-weighted Clinical Likelihood (CACS-CL) models <doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2020.09.585>,
    2019 Reeh et al. basic and clinical models <doi:10.1093/eurheartj/ehy806> and
    2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score <doi:10.1001/jamacardio.2016.5501>.
    As diagnosis of CAD involves a costly and invasive coronary angiography procedure for patients,
    having a reliable PTP for CAD helps doctors to make better decisions during patient management. 
    This ensures high risk patients can be diagnosed and treated early for CAD
    while avoiding unnecessary testing for low risk patients.
