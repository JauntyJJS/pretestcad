\title{Calculate Number Of Risk Factors (ESC 2024)}
\usage{

  have_family_history,
  have_smoking_history,
  have_dyslipidemia,
  have_hypertension,
  have_diabetes,
  max_na = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{have_family_history}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has a family history of CAD.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having a family history of CAD.
  \item yes stands for having a family history of CAD.
}}

\item{have_smoking_history}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has a smoking history (current or past smoker).
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having a smoking history (current or past smoker).
  \item yes stands for having a smoking history (current or past smoker).
}}

\item{have_dyslipidemia}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has dyslipidemia.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having dyslipidemia.
  \item yes stands for having a dyslipidemia.
}}

\item{have_hypertension}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has hypertension.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having hypertension.
  \item yes stands for having a hypertension.
}}

\item{have_diabetes}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has diabetes.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having diabetes.
  \item yes stands for having a diabetes.
}}

\item{max_na}{Input integer 0 to 5 to indicate the maximum number of
missing risk factors to tolerate before outputting an NA.
Default: 0}
}
\value{
An integer indicating the number of risk factors the patient has.
It can also be `NA` if the number of missing risk factors exceeds the `max_na`
input value
}
\description{
A function used to calculate the number of
risk factors the patient has. This is used to calculate the pretest
probability of coronary artery disease (CAD) based on the
ESC 2024 guidelines.
