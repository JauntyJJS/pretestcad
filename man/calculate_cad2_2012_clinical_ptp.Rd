\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the 2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) clinical model.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) clinical model.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on
patients from 18 hospitals in Europe and the United States.

The 2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) PTP models are as follows:
