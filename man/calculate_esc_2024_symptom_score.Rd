\title{Calculate Symptom Score (ESC 2024)}
\usage{
calculate_esc_2024_symptom_score(
  chest_pain_type,
  have_dyspnea,
  allow_na = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{chest_pain_type}{Input characters (no chest pain, typical, atypical, nonanginal)
to indicate the chest pain characteristics of the patient.

only has dyspnea symptoms.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having dyspnea symptoms.
  \item yes stands for having dyspnea symptoms.
}}

\item{allow_na}{A logical evaluating to TRUE or FALSE indicating whether we can
allow `chest_pain_type` or `have_dyspnea` to be NA when calculating the score.
Default: TRUE}
}
\value{
An integer indicating the symptom score of the patient.
It can also be `NA` if both `chest_pain_type` and `have_dyspnea` are `NA`.
}

This is used to calculate the pretest
