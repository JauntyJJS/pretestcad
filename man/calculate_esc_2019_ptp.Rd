\title{Calculate ESC 2019 PTP for obstructive CAD}
\usage{
calculate_esc_2019_ptp(
  age,
  sex = c(0, 1),
  dyspnea_only = c(0, 1),
  chest_pain = c(0, 1, 2, 3),
  output = c("grouping", "numeric", "percentage")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{Input integer to indicate the age of the patient.}

\item{sex}{Input integer 0 or 1 to indicate the sex of the patient.
Default: 0
\itemize{
  \item 0 stands for Female
  \item 1 stands for Male
}}

\item{dyspnea_only}{Input integer 0 or 1 to indicate if the patient
only has dyspnea symptoms.
Default: 0
\itemize{
  \item 0 stands for not having dyspnea-only symptoms. If the patient
  has chest pain symptoms, this value should also be set as 0 regardless
  if the patient has dyspnea or not.
  \item 1 stands for having dyspnea as the only primary symptom.
}}

\item{chest_pain}{Input integer 0 to 3 to indicate the chest pain
characteristics of the patient.
Default: 0
\itemize{
  \item 0 stands for the patient having no chest pain.
  \item 1 stands for the patient having typical chest pain.
  \item 2 stands for the patient having atypical chest pain.
  \item 3 stands for the patient having non-anginal chest pain.
}}

\item{output}{Input text to indicate the how pre-test
probability results be expressed
Default: c("grouping", "numeric", "percentage")
\itemize{
  \item grouping means the PTP will be expressed as Low, Intermediate and High.
  \itemize{
     \item Low if PTP is less than 5%.
     \item Intermediate if PTP is in between 5% to 15%.
     \item High if PTP is more than 15%.
  }
  \item numeric means the PTP will be expressed as an integer probability (0-100).
  \item percentage means the PTP will be expressed as percentage text (0-100\%).
}}
}
\value{
An integer or category representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the ESC 2019 guidelines.
See parameter option `output` for more information.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test Probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease (CAD) based on the
European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2019 guidelines.
}
\details{
The predictive model used to create the guidelines are based on
patients from European countries with low cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

The ESC 2019 PTP for CAD table is as follows:
