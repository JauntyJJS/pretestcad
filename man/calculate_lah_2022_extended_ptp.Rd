to indicate the chest pain characteristics of the patient.
\itemize{
  \item typical stands for the patient having typical chest pain.
  \item atypical stands for the patient having atypical chest pain.
  \item nonanginal stands for the patient having nonanginal or non-specific chest pain.
}}

\item{have_diabetes}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has diabetes.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having diabetes.
  \item yes stands for having diabetes.
}}

\item{have_hypertension}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has hypertension.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having hypertension.
  \item yes stands for having a hypertension.
}}

\item{have_dyslipidemia}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has dyslipidemia.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having dyslipidemia.
  \item yes stands for having a dyslipidemia.
}}

\item{have_smoking_history}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has a smoking history (current or past smoker).
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having a smoking history (non-smoker).
  \item yes stands for having a smoking history (current or past smoker).
}}

\item{coronary_calcium_score}{Input non-negative numeric to indicate the
total coronary calcium score of the patient.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the 2022 Local Assessment of the Heart (LAH) extended model.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2022 Local Assessment of the Heart (LAH) extended model.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on
patients a mixed Asian cohort within Singapore with stable chest pain.

\examples{
# 40 year old female with typical chest pain,
# diabetes but no hypertension, dyslipidemia,
# a non-smoker and a coronary calcium score of 0
