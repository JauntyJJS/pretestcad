\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) basic model.
}
\details{
The predictive model used to create the guidelines are based on
patients from 18 hospitals in Europe and the United States.

The 2012 CAD Consortium 2 (CAD2) PTP models are as follows:
