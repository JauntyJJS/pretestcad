}}

\item{hdl_mg_dl}{Input positive numeric value to indicate the
patient's high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in \eqn{mg/dL}.}

\item{is_minority_ethnicity}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
is from a racial or minority ethnicity
(or patient is not a non-Hispanic/Latino White).
\itemize{
  \item no stands for patient is a non-Hispanic/Latino White.

}}

\item{have_diabetes}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has diabetes.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having diabetes.

}}

\item{have_hypertension}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has hypertension.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having hypertension.
  \item yes stands for having a hypertension.
}}

\item{have_dyslipidemia}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has dyslipidemia.

}}

\item{have_stress_symptoms}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
has symptoms related to physical or mental stress. It can be set
to \code{NA} if the patient results are inconclusive or have not taken any stress test
such as exercise treadmill testing, stress echocardiography, or stress
nuclear imaging.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for no symptoms (negative results) related to physical or mental stress.
  \item yes stands for having symptoms (positive results) related to physical or mental stress.
  \item \code{NA} stands for inconclusive results or patient has not taken any stress test
}
Default: \code{NA}}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's minimal risk
score for obstructive CAD based on the 2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score.
}
\description{
This function returns
a symptomatic (have chest pain or dyspnea) patient's
minimal risk score for obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on CCTA images from 4632
patients in the Prospective Multicenter imaging Study for Evaluation
of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial.
