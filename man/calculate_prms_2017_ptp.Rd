\item{has_stress_symptoms}{Input integer 0 or 1 to indicate if the patient
has symptoms related to physical or mental stress. It can be set
to \code{NA} if the patient results are inconclusive or have not taken any stress test
such as exercise treadmill testing, stress echocardiography, or stress
nuclear imaging.
\itemize{
  \item 0 stands for no symptoms (negative results) related to physical or mental stress.

}
\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's minimal risk
score for obstructive CAD based on the 2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score.
}
\description{
This function returns
a symptomatic (have chest pain or dyspnea) patient's
minimal risk score for obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2017 PROMISE Minimal-Risk Score.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on CCTA images from 4632
patients in the Prospective Multicenter imaging Study for Evaluation
of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial.
