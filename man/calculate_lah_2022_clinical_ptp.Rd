\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the 2022 Local Assessment of the Heart (LAH) clinical model.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2022 Local Assessment of the Heart (LAH) clinical model.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on
patients a mixed Asian cohort within Singapore with stable chest pain.

The  2022 Local Assessment of the Heart (LAH) PTP models are as follows:
