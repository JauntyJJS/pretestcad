A numeric value representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the 2020 Winther et. al. basic model (Basic_PTP).

\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2020 Winther et. al. basic model (Basic_PTP).
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on > 40000 symptomatic
patients from 2008 to 2017 from 13 hospitals in Western Denmark. These
patients are registered under the Western Denmark Heart Registry.
