\arguments{
\item{age}{Input numeric value to indicate the age of the patient.}

\item{sex}{Input characters (female, male) to indicate the sex of the patient.
\itemize{
  \item female
  \item male
}}

\item{chest_pain_type}{Input characters (no chest pain, typical, atypical, nonanginal)
to indicate the chest pain characteristics of the patient.
\itemize{
  \item no chest pain stands for the patient having no chest pain.
  \item typical stands for the patient having typical chest pain.
  \item atypical stands for the patient having atypical chest pain.
  \item nonanginal stands for the patient having nonanginal or non-specific chest pain.
}}

\item{have_dyspnea}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has dyspnea symptoms.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having dyspnea symptoms.
  \item yes stands for having dyspnea symptoms.
}}

\item{have_family_history}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has a family history of CAD.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having a family history of CAD.
  \item yes stands for having a family history of CAD.
}}

\item{have_smoking_history}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has a smoking history (current or past smoker).
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having a smoking history (non-smoker).
  \item yes stands for having a smoking history (current or past smoker).
}}

\item{have_dyslipidemia}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has dyslipidemia.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having dyslipidemia.
  \item yes stands for having a dyslipidemia.
}}

\item{have_hypertension}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has hypertension.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having hypertension.
  \item yes stands for having a hypertension.
}}

\item{have_diabetes}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has diabetes.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having diabetes.
  \item yes stands for having diabetes.
}}

\item{coronary_calcium_score}{Input non-negative numeric to indicate the
total coronary calcium score of the patient.}

\item{allow_na_symptom_score}{A logical evaluating to \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} indicating whether we can
allow \code{chest_pain_type} or \code{have_dyspnea} to be \code{NA} when calculating the score}

\item{max_na_num_of_rf}{Input integer 0 to 5 to indicate the maximum number of
missing risk factors to tolerate before outputting an \code{NA}.
Default: 0}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the 2020 Winther et. al.
Coronary Artery Calcium Score-Weighted Clinical Likelihood (CACS-CL) model.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on
2020 Winther et. al.
Coronary Artery Calcium Score-Weighted Clinical Likelihood (CACS-CL) model.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on > 40000 symptomatic
patients from 2008 to 2017 from 13 hospitals in Western Denmark. These
patients are registered under the Western Denmark Heart Registry.
