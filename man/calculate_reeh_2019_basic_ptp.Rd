\arguments{
\item{age}{Input numeric value to indicate the age of the patient in years.}

}
\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the 2019 Reeh et. al. basic model.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2019 Reeh et. al. basic model.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on 3903
patients free of CAD and heart failure and suspected of angina, who were referred
to a single, large, urban university hospital for assessment in 2012â€“15.
}

    age = 40,
    sex = "female",
