\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease based on the
2019 Reeh et. al. basic model.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on 3903
patients free of CAD and heart failure and suspected of angina, who were referred
to a single, large, urban university hospital for assessment in 2012â€“15.
