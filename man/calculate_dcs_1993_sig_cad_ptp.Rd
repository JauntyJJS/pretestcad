}}

\item{have_smoking_history}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has a smoking history (current or past smoker).
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having a smoking history (non-smoker).

}}

\item{have_dyslipidemia}{Input characters (no, yes) to indicate if the patient
only has dyslipidemia.
\itemize{
  \item no stands for not having dyslipidemia.

}
\value{
A numeric value representing the patient's PTP for significant
(>75\% luminal diameter narrowing of at least one major coronary artery) CAD
based on the 1993 Duke Clinical Score.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test probability (PTP) of significant (>75\% luminal diameter narrowing
of at least one major coronary artery) coronary artery disease based on the
1993 Duke Clinical Score.
}
\details{
The predictive model is based on
patients referred for cardiac catheterisation between 1969 and 1983.
}
\examples{
# 40 year old female with typical chest pain,
# previous history of MI,
# has diabetes but no dyslipidemia and a non-smoker.
# She has Q waves but no ST-T changes on ECG.
