\usage{
calculate_aha_2012_tbl_9_ptp(
  age,
  sex,
  chest_pain_type,
  output = c("numeric", "percentage")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{Input integer value to indicate the age of the patient.}

\item{sex}{Input characters (female, male) to indicate the sex of the patient.
\itemize{
  \item female
  \item male
}}

\item{chest_pain_type}{Input characters (no chest pain, typical, atypical, nonanginal)
to indicate the chest pain characteristics of the patient.
\itemize{
  \item typical stands for the patient having typical chest pain.
  \item atypical stands for the patient having atypical chest pain.
  \item nonanginal stands for the patient having nonanginal or non-specific chest pain.
}}

\item{output}{Input text to indicate the how pre-test
probability results be expressed
Default: c("numeric", "percentage")
\itemize{
  \item numeric means the PTP will be expressed as an integer probability (0-100).
  \item percentage means the PTP will be expressed as percentage text (0-100\%).
}}
}
\value{
An integer or percentage representing the patient's PTP for obstructive CAD
based on the ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS 2012 guidelines.
}
\description{
This function returns a patient's
pre-test Probability (PTP) of obstructive
coronary artery disease (CAD) based on the
American College of Cardiology Foundation,
American Heart Association,
American College of Physicians,
American Association for Thoracic Surgery,
Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association,
Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions,
and Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2012 guidelines.
}
\details{
The predictive model used to create the guidelines are based on
patients from the Diamond and Forrester and the Coronary Artery Surgery Study.
